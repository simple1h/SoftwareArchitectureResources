# How to Contribute

## First

Please ensure you read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before making any type of contribution. 

## Submitting Changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to SoftwareArchitectureResources](https://github.com/tekiegirl/SoftwareArchitectureResources/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our contribution conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit, e.g. ).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Contribution Conventions

Take a look at the current content of the repository to get the idea, but here are some guidelines:

- Ensure your contribution complies with the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), e.g. does not include a link to offensive content. Any pull request or other contribution (e.g. issue) deemed to not comply with the Code of Conduct will be dealt with as specified in the Code of Conduct.
